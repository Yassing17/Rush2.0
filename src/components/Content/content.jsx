Some of the most significant factors responsible for the degradation and ecosystem damage are human usage and the introduction of invasive species. These ecosystems are shrinking, often due to development or land use changes. The areas on this map do not include private lands, provincial & federal lands, or Indigenous reservations.'},

Another study sprayed cedar essential oils in a hotel room before guests stayed, which had the same effect on their immune systems.

Urban centres that are densely populated are more likely to experience heat islands.'},
        {p: 'Some factors that contribute to heat islands are building material (e.g., cement), city design (buildings restricting air flow), and human heat sources (cars, AC etc.). ​​We can keep our neighbourhoods cooler during hot weather by increasing vegetation and the albedo of impervious surfaces (roads and buildings). Greenspace has many benefits, including providing shade, cleaning the air, and reducing noise2. Nature is great for your physical and mental wellbeing.

Intertidal fauna are sensitive to these changes and will die off quickly.'},

Kelp forests and eelgrass meadows also play an essential role for marine wildlife as food and habitat and protect maturing fish under their vast canopies. Herring use kelp as spawning sites. Kelp plays a vital role in the food chain because when they break up little organisms called detritus can eat them, and then larger creatures can eat those organisms! But since the 1970s, kelp and eelgrass in Puget Sound have rapidly disappeared. Scientists have pointed out that the main culprits are warming waters due to climate change, increasing populations of purple urchins consuming large amounts of kelp, and the rivalry of invasive seaweed species.
