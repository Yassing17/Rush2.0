        {p: 'What causes heat islands and heat waves? As average global temperatures rise, so does the likelihood of extreme hot temperatures resulting in heatwaves. These heatwaves will arrive earlier in the season, last longer and happen more often. City structures such as roads and buildings trap the sun’s heat and re-emit it. Urban city centres that are densely populated are more likely to experience heat islands. '},
        {p: 'Some factors that contribute to heat islands are building material (e.g., cement), city design (buildings restricting air flow), human heat sources (cars, AC etc.). ​​We can keep our neighbourhoods cooler in hot weather by increasing vegetation and increasing the albedo of impervious surfaces (roads and buildings). '},
        {p: 'Who/what is affected by the heat island effect? Animals, plants and people are vulnerable to extreme heat. Hot weather events increase the risk of forest fires. Prolonged heat dries out landscapes, and can shorten growing seasons for farmers. Pretty much anything you can think of is affected by hot temperatures. Viruses and bacteria are more likely to thrive in warmer temperatures, and are more transmissible during heat waves for animals (e.g., salmon) and humans. Intertidal fauna are sensitive to these changes and will die off quickly. '},

They use their tube feet and spines to walk along the seafloor and their teeth can cut through rocks.'},
